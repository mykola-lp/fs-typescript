# Patientor frontend

### Getting started
  - To get the app running just install its dependencies with ```npm install``` and run it with ```npm run dev```.
  - The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to ```/api/ping``` made on startup is successful before continuing.

## Exercises

### Exercise 23: Patientor, step1 (be)

We will soon add a new type for our app, Entry, which represents a lightweight patient journal entry. It consists of a journal text, i.e. a description, a creation date, information regarding the specialist who created it and possible diagnosis codes. Diagnosis codes map to the ICD-10 codes returned from the `/api/diagnoses` endpoint. Our naive implementation will be that a patient has an array of entries.

Before going into this, we need some preparatory work.

Create an endpoint `/api/patients/:id` to the backend that returns all of the patient information for one patient, including the array of patient entries that is still empty for all the patients. For the time being, expand the backend types as follows:

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type
export interface Entry {
}

export interface Patient {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  ssn: string;
  occupation: string;
  gender: Gender;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  entries: Entry[]
}

export type NonSensitivePatient = Omit<Patient, 'ssn' | 'entries'>;
```

### Exercise 24: Patientor, step2

Create a page for showing a patient's full information in the frontend.

The user should be able to access a patient's information by clicking the patient's name.

Fetch the data from the endpoint created in the previous exercise.

You may use [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) for the new components but that is up to you since our main focus now is TypeScript.

You might want to have a look at [part 7](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/react_router) if you don't yet have a grasp on how the [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) works.

> The example uses [Material UI Icons](https://mui.com/components/material-icons/) to represent genders.

### Exercise 25: Patientor, step3 (be)

Define the types `OccupationalHealthcareEntry` and `HospitalEntry` so that they conform to the new example data.

Ensure that your backend returns the entries properly when you go to an individual patient's route.
